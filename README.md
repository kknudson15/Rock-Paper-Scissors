# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Description:
This was a group project that was worked on it collaberation with Joe Palmerston and John T. Ajala
The goal of this project was to construct a Rock- Paper - Scissors game in which two contestants each select either Rock, Paper, or scissors in each round.  The winner of each round is determined by the traditional rules of rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper and paper beating rock.   Any other combination of these three options is considered a draw. This base of this project pits two players against each other in each round.  Each player is represented by a thread in the program with the same instance of the threads being used for all the rounds.  During each round the selection of the players is compared and a winner is determined for the round and messages are displayed to the terminal that correspond to various important events that are occuring during the game simulation.   In this project the simulation is run for 1000 rounds but could be run for any amount of rounds, n.  After the final round is complete, summary statistics are displayed on the terminal


Data Structures:
arrays, (uses threads)
